;; Note on terminology: We treat mustache templates as a sequence of
;; strings (plain text), and tags (anything wrapped in delimeters:
;; {{foo}}). A section is a special tag that requires closing
;; (e.g. {{#foo}}{{/foo}}).

;; We treat mustache templates as if they conform to a rough grammar:

;; TEMPLATE = plaintext | TAG | SECTION | TEMPLATE TEMPLATE
;; SECTION = OPEN-TAG TEMPLATE CLOSE-TAG
;; TAG = "{{" text "}}"

;; Public functions are of the form `mustache-FOO`, private
;; functions/variables are of the form `mst--FOO`.

;;; Code:

(load "mustache-render.el")

(declare-function mst--render "mustache-render")

;; todo: add flag to set tolerance of missing variables
(defun mustache-render (template context)
  "Render a mustache TEMPLATE with hash table CONTEXT."
  (mst--render template context))

(defvar mustache-partial-paths nil
  "A list of paths to be searched for mustache partial templates (files ending .mustache).")

(defvar mustache-key-type 'string
  "What type of key we expect in contexts.
Can take the value 'string or 'keyword.

For 'string we expect contexts of the form:
#s\(hash-table data \(\"name\" \"J. Random user\"\)\)

for 'keyword we expect contexts of the form:
#s\(hash-table data \(:name \"J. Random user\"\)\)")

(provide 'mustache)
